Allow students to see all of their submissions (and feedback)

This is a quick LTI that allows a student to view all of their submissions for each assignment in a course. The submissions and attachments to submissions are shown as previews of the, for example, CrocoDoc or Arc feedback entered in SpeedGrader.
